# ABAP Open Source Namespaces

## About this project

In response to the suggestions and feedback from our community, SAP made available dedicated [ABAP Open Source Namespaces](https://me.sap.com/namespaces/opensource). The list of already existing namespaces is [available in the Development Namespace Application](https://me.sap.com/namespaces/opensource). In addition, we list them here, including the development and repair keys for DEMOSYSTEM installations like the [ABAP Cloud Developer Trial](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/abap-cloud-developer-trial-2022-available-now/ba-p/13598069). If you would like to create an own namespace for an open source project, please reach out to the [SAP Open Source Program Office via e-mail](mailto:ospo@sap.com). Weâ€™ll be happy to get your project onboarded.
If you have any questions or feedback regarding ABAP Open Source Namespaces, feel free to post a issue here or [reach out to us via e-mail](mailto:ospo@sap.com).
